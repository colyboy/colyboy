            Δ Industrial Light & Magic showing some of the very impressive CGI that went into bringing Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom to life. But was the movie any good? I still haven't seen it because a friend told me it was a waste of time. "No, your mom wouldn't take you because it's PG-13." Would you believe not a single person responded to my 'pretend to be my guardian' Craigslist ad?  <br>

            Ε This is the officially licensed Star Wars Galactic Empire DSA Keycap Set (no keyboard included). Each PBT dye-sublimated keycap features the Aurebesh language, one of the most used languages in the galaxy. The 157-key set (including '8 unique novelty keycaps to show your loyalty to the Empire') comes in two varieties: pure Aurebesh, or Aurebesh with small english sublegends in upper right corner of each key. Unfortunately for the person looking for the perfect Christmas gift for the Star Wars fan in their life who already has absolutely everything else, they're currently only available for pre-order, and won't ship until March or April. And even more unfortunately for everyone who isn't filthy rich, each set costs a staggering $250. *spit-takes lemonade* $250?! If I had $250 to spend on a set of keycaps I wouldn't have a purpose for a keyboard, I'd just yell to my butler to write all my emails for me. And I certainly wouldn't have to pretending this margarita is just lemonade.  <br>

            Γ  The Star Trek TNG Captain's Tea Set This is the Star Trek Captain's Tea Set available exclusively from ThinkGeek ($60). It includes a teapot with the United Federation of Planets logo, sugar bowl, creamer pitcher and two teacups with the Starfleet Command logo, and two saucers with Star Trek: The Next Generation's 'U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701-D' designation. Admittedly, I like the handles on the teacups, they look like they'll make them easy to drop. And you know how I feel about breaking things. "It's one of the very few things you're good at." Please *wiping Greg's laptop off his desk with a flourish* It's the ONLY thing I'm good at <br>

            Γ Keep going for one more shot while I write an angry email complaining these look nothing like the actual clear glass teacup Captain Picard drank his Earl Grey out of.<br>

        <div class="anl"><p>Ζ An Analysis Of Why There Are So Few Smartphones In Popular Movies  <br>

            Ζ This is a video analysis created by The Nerdwriter discussing why there are so few smartphones seen in popular movies. The video is almost eight minutes long, but his basic idea is that "the most popular things -- the biggest movies, TV shows and even digital media, are a reflection of what we want to see," and we don't want to see people with their noses buried in smartphones all the time and if you did you could literally look anywhere else but a movie screen. It's all about escapism. "Did you even watch it?" What part of 'the video is almost eight minutes long' did you not understand? Besides, I know I'm right.  <br>
            
            Ζ Adjust the size of your font and any other appropriate properties to make sure it's readable on both large and small screens.<br>
