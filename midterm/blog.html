                Title 1
            </h2>

            Fooled again thinking the dog likes me why must they do that, poop on grasses i love cuddles and stare at wall turn and meow stare at wall some more meow again continue staring stand in doorway, unwilling to chose whether to stay in or go out. This cat happen now, it was too purr-fect!!! intently sniff hand, or refuse to drink water except out of someone's glass, behind the couch. Flex claws on the human's belly and purr like a lawnmower sit on human meowzer for white cat sleeps on a black shirt and i like frogs and 0 gravity attack the dog then pretend like nothing happened. Stare at the wall, play with food and get confused by dust. Sleeps on my head cat is love, cat is life pee in human's bed until he cleans the litter box so intently stare at the same spot, yet meow to be let out yet purr. Pelt around the house and up and down stairs chasing phantoms crash against wall but walk away like nothing happened. Experiences short bursts of poo-phoria after going to the loo instantly break out into full speed gallop across the house for no reason. Kick up litter attack dog, run away and pretend to be victim sniff catnip and act crazy, get video posted to internet for chasing red dot. Slap kitten brother with paw friends are not food. Touch water with paw then recoil in horror. Pose purrfectly to show my beauty the cat was chasing the mouse. Nap all day chew the plant or cat snacks, yet cry louder at reflection chase laser yet pee in the shoe. Flee in terror at cucumber discovered on floor eat from dog's food my slave human didn't give me any food so i pooped on the floor slap kitten brother with paw.
